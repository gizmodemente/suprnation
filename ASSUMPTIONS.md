DON'T assume that input strings only contains number but I assume that only Integer numbers can be used for input.

```
Input: 4 3 12 18
Input: ajf4.3 12m18

Both produces: List(4,3,12,18)
```

I assume that only complete triangles must be accepted:

```
1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4 

It's OK

1
2 2
3 3
4 4 4

It's NO OK
```

I assume that input file (if used) don't have empty lines at the end.
